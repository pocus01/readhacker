# Readhacker v1.0

Readhacker is an experiment in prototyping an AI-powered reading assistant webapp.
You provide the text. The current app version offers several options to analyse the text.
These include:

1. Summarize the text
2. Extract the key trends and figures
3. Generate a timeline of key events
4. Describe the tone of the text and identify potential biases
5. Assess the implications
6. Offer contrarian views
7. Highlight alternative angles that are not covered
